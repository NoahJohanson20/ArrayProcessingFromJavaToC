# ArrayProcessingFromJavaToC

For an Algorithm Analysis class at Kennesaw State University I was given an Array sorting program in Java and asked to convert the entire file to C++
Instead of using arrays in C++ I was allowed to use Vectors which allowed me to use Vecotr.size() for more efficient processing.
